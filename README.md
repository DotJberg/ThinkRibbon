# Think Ribbon

Think Ribbon is a social platform for gamers. Users can write posts, articles, and reviews, track games in a Quest Log, build collections, and follow other gamers.

This is a side project I built to learn TypeScript, React, and full-stack development. It's been a playground for picking up new tools and figuring out how everything fits together; from server-side rendering to real-time databases to mobile builds.
