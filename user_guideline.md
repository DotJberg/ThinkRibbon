# Community Guidelines - February 2026

Welcome! This platform is a space for gamers to share opinions, discover games, and connect with others. To keep it fun and respectful, please follow these guidelines.

## Be Respectful

- No harassment, bullying, or personal attacks. Disagree with opinions, not people.
- No hate speech. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or nationality is not tolerated.
- No doxxing. Never share someone's personal information without consent.
- Respect different tastes. Someone liking a game you hate (or hating a game you love) is not a personal attack.

## Keep It Honest

- Write genuine reviews. Your ratings and reviews should reflect your actual experience.
- No review bombing. Don't rate games you haven't played or organize campaigns to manipulate scores.
- Disclose affiliations. If you received a free copy, work for the developer, or have a conflict of interest, say so.
- No impersonation. Don't pretend to be developers, journalists, or other users.

## Spoiler Etiquette

- Use spoiler tags. Mark story spoilers.
- Keep titles spoiler-free. Don't put spoilers in post titles or review headlines.

## Content Rules

- No illegal content. This includes piracy links, leaks under NDA, or anything unlawful.
- No spam or self-promotion abuse. Sharing your content occasionally is fine; flooding the feed is not.

## Healthy Discourse

- Criticism is welcome; toxicity is not. You can dislike a game, studio, or trend—just express it constructively.
- No console warring. Platform debates are fine; tribalism and flame wars are not.
- Engage in good faith. Don't bait, troll, or intentionally provoke others.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:

- Warning – For minor or first-time offenses
- Content removal – Posts/reviews that violate guidelines
- Temporary suspension – Repeated or moderate violations
- Permanent ban – Severe or repeated violations

We review reports and context before taking action. If you see something that violates these guidelines, please report it.

## TL;DR

Be kind. Be honest. Use spoiler tags. Don't be a jerk.
